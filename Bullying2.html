      <div class="col-md-9">
      <p class="mytext">Physical bullying is the most obvious form of bullying. It occurs when kids use physical actions to gain power and control over their targets. Physical bullies tend to be bigger, stronger, and more aggressive than their peers. Examples of physical bullying include kicking, hitting, punching, slapping, shoving, and other physical attacks.Unlike other forms of bullying, physical bullying is the easiest to identify. As a result, it is most likely what people think of when they think of bullying. Additionally, it has historically received more attention from schools than other more subtle forms of bullying.

      </div>
      <div class="col-md-9">
      <p class="mytext">Perpetrators of verbal bullying use words, statements, and name-calling to gain power and control over a target. Typically, verbal bullies will use relentless insults to belittle, demean, and hurt another person. They choose their targets based on the way they look, act, or behave. It’s also common for verbal bullies to target kids with special needs.

      <p class="sidett"><b>Cyberbullying</b></p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-9">
      <p class="mytext">When a tween or a teen uses the Internet, a smartphone, or other technology to harass, threaten, embarrass, or target another person, this is called cyberbullying. If an adult is involved in the harassment this is called cyber-harassment or cyberstalking.Examples of cyberbullying include posting hurtful images, making online threats, and sending hurtful emails or texts. Because teens and tweens are always "plugged in," cyberbullying is a growing issue among young people. It’s also becoming more widespread because bullies can harass their targets with much less risk of being caught.

      <p class="sidett"><b>Sexual Bullying</b></p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-9">
      <p class="mytext">Sexual bullying consists of repeated, harmful, and humiliating actions that target a person sexually. Examples include sexual name-calling, crude comments, vulgar gestures, uninvited touching, sexual propositioning, and pornographic materials. For instance, a bully might make a crude comment about a girl’s appearance, attractiveness, sexual development, or sexual activity. In extreme cases, sexual bullying opens the door to sexual assault.
